04/10/2017: This might be one error pump out when loading the html files, as in the source code there was declared to import one css file called 'Shoppingcart.css'. But actually, in my implementation, it was no needed anymore, which was one empty file actually, so I delete this css file but forget commit the import line in the html source file, which course the 'GET' error. Wish this might not affect TAs evaluation.


[Note: The simpleCart.js was the same as "https://rawgit.com/soooocitrus/simplecart-js/master/simpleCart.js", which was forked from repository "https://github.com/wojodesign/simplecart-js.git". For easy management, I copy the code here. If necessary, you could check the forked repository under the same account "soooocitrus"]
